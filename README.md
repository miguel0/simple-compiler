# simple-compiler
To run the compiler simply execute:  
`python compparse.py`  
You will then be asked for a file name. The file will be compiled and the TAC will be written in "out.txt".  
  
You can take a look at "sample_input.txt" to see the expected syntax for the input along with any assumptions made for the syntax. The TAC for that file can be found in "sample_output.txt".
